Contains the various lesson plans that we came up with to present in the course. We worked as a team for two projects, where we had around 30 minutes to introduce a new topic and derive some equations.
The final lesson plan was an individual project and it was to learn how to plan a lesson for 1-2 weeks.
We also had to do some personal tutoring sessions. I chose to go help students during their office hours for two months.
We had to write about those as "Notes" and describe how our experience was during these sessions.
