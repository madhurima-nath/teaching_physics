Contains the various lesson plans that we came up with to present in the course. We worked as a team for two projects, where we had around 30 minutes to introduce a new topic and derive some equations.
The final lesson plan was an individual project and it was to learn how to plan a lesson for 1-2 weeks.
We also had to do some personal tutoring sessions. I chose to go help students during their office hours for two months.
We had to write about those as "Notes" and describe how our experience was during these sessions.




Being Graduate Teaching Assistant for 2 years, I taught and facilitated laboratory sessions and recitation classes for introductory physics courses. These courses included mechanics, electro-magnetism, acoustics etc. As a part of being GTA, I have also helped undergraduate students during office hours and tutoring sessions. I have also taken a Physics Teaching and learning course wherein we focussed on using more effective teaching strategies and how people learn and understand key concepts in physics. This course also improved my teaching skills and I wrote various lesson plans and worked as a team.
I have also actively taken part in the Physics Outreach program where basic physics concepts are explained to local K-12 schools using fun demos. 



I strongly believe that teaching helps me learn the subject matter more. I love interacting with students and teaching them some simple science - physics or math concepts. When I was a student, I used to get amazed how day-to-day activities involves physics and I am very excited to tell this to others. This is why I was a active participant in the Virginia Tech Physics outreach program. I was an organizer and a speaker at the APS Conference for Undergraduate Women, which gave me the opportunity to encourage more female to take up physics and math. To learn more about how various research can help the community, I decided to be a part of the Editorial board of our Graduate Student journal, Community Change.
